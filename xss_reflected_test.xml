    <name>Reflected XSS in search input</name>
    <severity>High</severity>
    <path>/search.php?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script></path>
    <issueBackground>
      A reflected XSS vulnerability exists when user input is immediately returned by the server without proper sanitization. An attacker can craft a malicious link with JavaScript that executes when the victim visits it.
      🔍 This example used payload: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a GET request.
      💡 AI Advice: Encode output using HTML entity encoding before rendering user input. Consider using frameworks that handle this automatically.
